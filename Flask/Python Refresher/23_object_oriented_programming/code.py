-> self consists of the attributes grades and name within the context of the Student class. These attributes are associated with any instance created from this class.

-> When you create an object (or instance) of the Student class, named student, this object contains its own set of attributes (name and grades) defined in the class.

-> You can call methods defined in the class (like average) on this object (student). When you do, the method can access the object's attributes and other methods using self.
